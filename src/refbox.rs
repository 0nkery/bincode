/// A struct for encoding nested reference types.
///
/// Encoding large objects by reference is really handy.  For example,
/// `encode(&large_hashmap, ...)` encodes the large structure without having to
/// own the hashmap.  However, it is impossible to serialize a reference if that
/// reference is inside of a struct.
///
/// ```ignore rust
/// // Not possible, rustc can not decode the reference.
/// #[derive(RustcEncoding, RustcDecoding)]
/// struct Message<'a>  {
///   big_map: &'a HashMap<u32, u32>,
///   message_type: String,
/// }
/// ```
///
/// This is because on the decoding side, you can't create the Message struct
/// because it needs to have a reference to a HashMap, which is impossible because
/// during deserialization, all members need to be owned by the deserialized
/// object.
///
/// This is where RefBox comes in.  During serialization, it serializs a reference,
/// but during deserialization, it puts that sub-object into a box!
///
/// ```ignore rust
/// // This works!
/// #[derive(RustcEncoding, RustcDecoding)]
/// struct Message<'a> {
///     big_map: RefBox<'a, HashMap<u32, u32>>,
///     message_type: String
/// }
/// ```
///
/// Now we can write
///
/// ```ignore rust
/// let my_map = HashMap::new();
/// let my_msg = Message {
///     big_map: RefBox::new(&my_map),
///     message_type: "foo".to_string()
/// };
///
/// let encoded = encode(&my_msg, ...).unwrap();
/// let decoded: Message<'static> = decode(&encoded[]).unwrap();
/// ```
///
/// Notice that we managed to encode and decode a struct with a nested reference
/// and that the decoded message has the lifetime `'static` which shows us
/// that the message owns everything inside it completely.
///
/// Please don't stick RefBox inside deep data structures.  It is much better
/// suited in the outermost layer of whatever it is that you are encoding.
